# Hi there 👋, I'm Daniel

I'm a Software Engineer with multiple years of experience in the Ruby, Python,
and Javascript ecosystems. I love diving into new technologies and am a big
proponent of always reading the docs.

I come from a background in philosophy and formal logic and have always loved
solving puzzles. Last year, I solved all days of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) 2024, which
I'm pretty proud of. You can see my solutions
[here](https://github.com/dchae/Advent_of_Code).

## Kubrick

Recently, I built [Kubrick](https://kubrick-ai.com/), an open-source deployable
ingestion pipeline and API for multimodal semantic search over video, enabling
users or RAG systems to retrieve video segments using natural language, images,
audio, and video queries.

**Technologies Used:** Python, TypeScript, Terraform, React, Next.js,
PostgreSQL, pgvector, Astro, AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, SQS, API Gateway, ELB, IAM,
Bedrock, RDS, DynamoDB)
